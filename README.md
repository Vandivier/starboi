# Compared to Rockstarboi

Starboi is relatively bare-bones, and great for new react learners.

Rockstarboi extends the Starboi concept to support community feedback on anecdotes.

Rockstarboi uses more complicated coding patterns and library integrations, including:

1. Material

2. Prettier

3. Error Boundaries

4. Redux

5. Prisma

6. Next.js

7. NextAuth

8. Vercel

9. react-hook-form vs contentEditable
